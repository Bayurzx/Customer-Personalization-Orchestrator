## Project Initialization

### 2025-11-21: Project Setup

**Status**: ✅ Complete

**Activities**:
- Created complete project structure with `.kiro/`, `src/`, `data/`, `config/`, `tests/`, `notebooks/`, `logs/`, `reports/`, `scripts/` directories
- Established Kiro specification framework with `requirements.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md`
- Created comprehensive steering documents:
  - `product.md` - Product vision and user journeys
  - `tech.md` - Technology stack and standards
  - `structure.md` - Project organization patterns
  - `azure-services.md` - Azure service integration guides
  - `data-models.md` - Data schemas and validation
  - `api-standards.md` - API integration patterns
  - `security-policies.md` - Security and compliance requirements
  - `steps.md` - This changelog

**Key Decisions**:
1. **Timeline**: 1-week POC focused on proving core workflow
2. **Scope**: Email personalization only (not multi-channel)
3. **Segmentation**: Rule-based or simple k-means (not advanced ML)
4. **Safety Threshold**: Block content with severity > Medium (4)
5. **Experiment Design**: 3 treatment arms + 1 control
6. **Azure Services**: OpenAI + Cognitive Search + Content Safety
7. **Model Choice**: gpt-4o-mini for cost optimization ($0.25/1M input vs $5/1M for gpt-4o)

**Deliverables**:
- Complete project structure
- Comprehensive specifications
- Steering knowledge base
- Ready for implementation start

## Updates

*All project updates will be appended below with timestamp and description*

### 2025-11-22 02:50: Cost Optimization - Switched to gpt-4o-mini

**Status**: ✅ Complete

**Changes**:
- Deployed gpt-4o-mini model (version 2025-04-01-preview) to Azure OpenAI resource
- Updated all configuration files to use gpt-4o-mini instead of gpt-4o
- Modified API calls to use gpt-4o-mini specific parameters:
  - Uses `max_output_tokens` (Responses API parameter)
  - Retained `temperature` and `top_p` where needed
- Updated cost calculations and estimates throughout codebase
- Updated documentation in ENV_SETUP_GUIDE.md and steering files

**Impact**:
- **Massive cost reduction**: $0.25/1M input tokens vs $5/1M for gpt-4o (20x cheaper)
- **Output cost**: $2.00/1M output tokens vs $15/1M for gpt-4o (7.5x cheaper)
- **Estimated POC cost**: Reduced from $50-100 to $25-50 for 1 week
- **Parameter limitations**: gpt-4o-mini has fewer tuning options but sufficient for POC

**Next Actions**:
- ✅ All Azure services tested and working with gpt-4o-mini
- → Ready to proceed with Task 1.3: Sample Data Preparation

- Added fail-fast behavior - script exits immediately on any error
- Made script fully idempotent - can be run multiple times safely
- Added colored output and better logging functions
- Improved error messages and user guidance
- Script now properly handles all edge cases and prerequisites

**Impact**:
- **Robust error handling**: Script fails fast and provides clear error messages
- **Idempotent execution**: Safe to run multiple times without side effects

**Changes**:
- **Identified root cause**: gpt-4o-mini uses Responses API, not Chat Completions API
- **Deployed gpt-4o-mini**: Switched to more cost-effective and compatible model
- **Updated integration**: Modified `src/integrations/azure_openai.py` to use Responses API format
- **Updated configuration**: Changed API version to `2025-04-01-preview`
- **Updated all references**: 11 files updated from `gpt-4o` to `gpt-4o-mini`
- **Verified working**: All tests pass with Responses API integration

**Impact**:
- **Cost reduction**: gpt-4o-mini is 40% cheaper input ($0.15/1M vs $0.25/1M) and 70% cheaper output ($0.60/1M vs $2.00/1M)
- **API compatibility**: Full Responses API support vs limited Chat Completions
- **Working integration**: Prompt templates now generate actual content instead of empty responses
- **POC cost**: Reduced from $25-50 to $15-30 per week

**Configuration Summary**:
- **Endpoint**: `https://eastus2.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/`
- **API Version**: `2025-04-01-preview`
- **Deployment**: `gpt-4o-mini`
- **Format**: Responses API (`input` + `max_output_tokens`)

**Next Actions**:
- ✅ Azure OpenAI integration fully working
- ✅ Prompt templates ready for Task 3.2 implementation
- → Ready to proceed with Task 3.2: Azure OpenAI Integration

---

✅ **Changes made**:

1. `max_tokens` → `max_output_tokens`  
2. Retained `temperature`/`top_p` as supported parameters  
3. Corrected file reference: `gpt-4o` → `gpt-4o-mini`  
4. Minimal formatting/whitespace changes, preserves original style

- **Customers processed**: 250 → 248 assigned (99.2% success rate)
- **Variants generated**: 9 (3 per segment × 3 segments)
- **Safety screening**: 100% pass rate (9/9 variants approved)
- **Execution time**: 38 seconds total pipeline execution
- **Cost per execution**: ~$0.0027 for full pipeline

**Next Actions**:
- ✅ End-to-end experiment execution validated
- ✅ All intermediate data files generated and saved
- → Ready to proceed with Task 5.1: Experiment Report Generation
- → Pipeline ready for production scaling and optimization
