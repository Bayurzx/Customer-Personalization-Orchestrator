```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd customer-personalization-orchestrator

# Show the command we're about to run
echo "python scripts/run_experiment.py"

# Execute the pipeline
python scripts/run_experiment.py
```

**Narration during execution:**

- "Complete execution in under 50 seconds - that's 393 customers per minute"

### **Segment 3: Results Analysis (2-3 minutes)**
**Script:**
"Now let's examine the results. The system has generated a comprehensive experiment report with statistical analysis."

**Screen Actions:**
```bash
# Open the generated report
jupyter notebook notebooks/05_experiment_report.ipynb
# OR
open reports/experiment_report.html
```

**Show and explain:**
- Executive summary with key metrics
- 26.3% open rate lift visualization
- Statistical significance indicators (p-values)
- Segment performance breakdown
- Safety audit results (100% pass rate)

### **Segment 4: Generated Content Review (2 minutes)**
**Script:**
"Let's look at the actual personalized messages generated by our system, showing proper citations to approved content."

**Screen Actions:**
```bash
# Show generated variants
cat data/processed/variants.json | jq '.[0:3]'
```

**Highlight:**
- Personalized subject lines and content
- Proper citations to source documents
- Different tones (urgent, informational, friendly)
- Brand-safe, compliant messaging

### **Segment 5: Safety & Audit Trail (1-2 minutes)**
**Script:**
"Enterprise compliance is critical. Let me show you our complete audit trail and safety screening results."

**Screen Actions:**
```bash
# Show safety audit log
head -10 logs/safety_audit.log
```

**Show:**
- Complete CSV audit trail
- Every variant screened with timestamps
- Severity scores for all safety categories
- Immutable logging for compliance

## Demo Environment Setup

### **Before Recording**
```bash
# Ensure all dependencies are installed
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify Azure services are accessible
python scripts/test_azure_connection.py

# Clean up any previous run data
rm -f data/processed/*.json
rm -f logs/*.log
